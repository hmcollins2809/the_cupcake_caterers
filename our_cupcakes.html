            <h3>Who are The Cupcake Caterers?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We are a Dublin-based catering company with a singular mission: to bring cupcakes to you! We deliver anywhere in Dublin city, and can have your order ready to go as soon as the same day. (Note: custom orders and orders of over 50 cupcakes will require additional notice. Please contact us for more information.)</p>
            <br>
            <p>We were founded in 2021, when husband and wife duo Aoife and Cathal (hi!) asked themselves a single, life-changing question: what if there was a catering company, that only made cupcakes? No cronuts, no croissants, no macaroons - just cupcakes, in every flavour and variety our customers could think of. Sicilian Lemon, Red Velvet, Peppermint Mocha Whirl . . . the possibilties are endless, and at The Cupcake Caterers, we're happy to explore them with you! Send us a message over at the "Contact Us" page, and let us know what you have in mind. One of our team will be back in touch within 24 hours to discuss creating your custom bake.</p>
            <br>
