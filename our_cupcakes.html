            <h3>Who are The Cupcake Caterers?</h3>
            <br>
            <p>We are a Dublin-based catering company with a singular mission: to bring cupcakes to you! We deliver anywhere in Dublin city, and can have your order ready to go as soon as the same day. (Note: custom orders and orders of over 50 cupcakes will require additional notice. Please contact us for more information.)</p>
            <br>
            <p>We were founded in 2021, when husband and wife duo Aoife and Cathal (hi!) asked themselves a single, life-changing question: what if there was a catering company, that only made cupcakes? No cronuts, no croissants, no macaroons - just cupcakes, in every flavour and variety our customers could think of. Sicilian Lemon, Red Velvet, Peppermint Mocha Whirl . . . the possibilties are endless, and at The Cupcake Caterers, we're happy to explore them with you! Send us a message over at the "Contact Us" page, and let us know what you have in mind. One of our team will be back in touch within 24 hours to discuss creating your custom bake.</p>
            <br>

        <h2>Six Classic Flavours</h2>
        <div class="classic-cupcakes">
            <h4>Sicilian Lemon</h4>
            <img src="assets/images/cristina-matos-albers-Ltv7a5m8i4c-unsplash.jpg" alt="Picture of a lemon cupcake">
            <p>Clean, classic sponge with a hidden lemon curd centre and lashings of our tangy buttercream icing. All topped off with a liberal sprinkle of lemon zest.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classic-cupcakes">
            <h4>Triple Chocolate</h4>
            <img src="assets/images/chocolate-cupcake-cropped.jpg" alt="Picture of a selection of chocolate cupcakes">
            <p>What could be better than a rich, gooey chocolate base? How about a handful of chocolate chips, and a dollop of choc-tastic buttercream icing to finish it all off? Triple Choc lovers understand: the only thing better than chocolate is more chocolate.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classic-cupcakes">
            <h4>Red Velvet</h4>
            <img src="assets/images/red-velvet-cupcake-cropped.jpg" alt="A picture of a red velvet cupcake">
            <p>Red Velvet is a little bit romantic. A little bit decadent. A little bit . . . special. For those occasions when you just need something more, Red Velvet has you covered. Sumptuous red chocolate sponge, a melt-in-the-middle chocolate coffee filling, and a cream cheese icing topping. Treat yourself to a taste of luxury.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classic-cupcakes">
            <h4>Bubblegum Blast</h4>
            <img src="assets/images/bubblegum-cupcake-cropped.jpg" alt="Picture of a blue iced cupcake">
            <p>It's bold. It's bright. It's . . . blue? Don't be afraid, it's still delicious. A light blueberry-flavoured sponge, topped with thick bubblegum icing and a sweet white chocolate heart, just for you. It's a blast.</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classic-cupcakes">
            <h4>Millie's Vanilla</h4>
            <img src="assets/images/vanilla-cupcakes-cropped.jpg" alt="Picture of some vanilla cupcakes">
            <p>Sweet, simple, timeless. Sometimes you just can't improve on a classic. This combination of light and fluffy vanilla sponge with vanilla buttercream icing and sweet sprinkle decoration was invented for our daughter Millie's fourth birthday party, and has been a firm favourite ever since!</p>
        </div>

        <div class="classic-cupcakes">
            <h4>Strawberry Sweetie</h4>
            <img src="assets/images/strawberry-cupcake-cropped.jpg" alt="Picture of a strawberry cupcake">
            <p>Vanilla, chocolate, strawberry. Some things, you just have to have. A classic sponge base lets our strawberry-flavoured icing sing out - but it's the whole white chocolate-enrobed strawberry on top that really steals the show. Who said strawberry had to be simple?</p>
